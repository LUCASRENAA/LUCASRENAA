## About
I am a Cybersecurity Engineer with a strong passion for technology and information security. With extensive experience in secure software development and penetration testing, I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to grow. I firmly believe that innovation is key to achieving meaningful results.

My expertise lies in application security, particularly with a focus on Python programming for secure implementations. I have hands-on experience with threat modeling, Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST and DAST), and penetration testing. Additionally, I hold certifications across various security domains and cloud computing, which allows me to effectively navigate security and compliance challenges within cloud environments.
